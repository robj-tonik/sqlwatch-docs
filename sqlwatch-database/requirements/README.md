# Requirements

{% hint style="success" %}
#### SQL Server Standard and Enterprise

* **2008 R2 SP3** _\(details below\)_
* **2012**
* **2014**
* **2016**
* **2017**
* **2019**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**SQL Server Express**

Express Edition is supported with **Windows Task Scheduler** in place for SQL Agent. Since version 2.2 Power Shell templates can be generated to help create all relevant tasks and schedules. Task creation tested on **Windows Server 2012** and **Windows Server 2016**.

`exec [dbo].[usp_sqlwatch_config_set_default_agent_jobs] @print_WTS_command = 1`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
#### Virtual Machines in the Cloud

Any Virtual Machine with the above SQL Server version will work in the Cloud \(Azure, AWS, GCP\)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Azure SQL Managed Instances 

According to Microsoft they are 100% compatible with the traditional installation. **However, this has not been tested.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Docker** and **Linux** 

Both are supported except the disk collector which relies on the Windows' WMI interface. Currently there is no equivalent for Linux implemented.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3

Whilst not officially supported, SQLWATCH will work on **SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3** with few small modifications.

1. Download source code from GitHub and open in Visual Studio with [Data Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt). Since Visual Studio 2019, Data Tools are available as an extension. 
2. Once the below changes have been implemented, right click on the Project, go to Properties and change Target Platform to SQL 2008. Project should build successfully.

* Extended events sessions will not deploy. They will need to be commented out before deployment.
* Procedure `[dbo].[usp_sqlwatch_internal_get_last_snapshot_time_in_tables]` will need to be modified and the final `with result sets` removed. _This procedure is only used by the central repository which is targeted at SSIS 2012:_
* View `vw_sqlwatch_sys_databases` will need to be modified and join on `left join sys.dm_hadr_availability_replica_states hars` removed. This will force removal of the remaining joins and essentially reverting back issue [\#108](https://github.com/marcingminski/sqlwatch/issues/108): 
* Depending on what PowerShell modules are installed in addition to SQL Server, some PowerShell agent steps may not work. As a workaround, These can be triggered from Windows Task Scheduler. _See installation on the Express Edition_.

**SQL Server 2008 R2 prior to SP3 are not supported**
