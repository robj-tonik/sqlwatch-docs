# Reports

Reports is a standalone module that can be run on a set schedule, or triggered by an action. For example, we can have a daily "Status" report or even a business process saving generated file to a shared drive. 

Actions can also trigger a report. For example, we can have a Check to check for space left on drives and send us a report when the thresholds are low. 

> Reports are usually more complex and quite often require more resources to execute. By using the Check engine to trigger reports the performance impact is reduced to minimum.

Reports are defined in table `[dbo].[sqlwatch_config_report]` and can be associated with actions in table `[dbo].[sqlwatch_config_report_action]` in a similar manner to how checks are associated with actions

{% hint style="info" %}
Reports are always generated in HTML therefore action must also support HTML tags. If you are using **sp\_send\_mail** set the **@body\_format = 'HTML'**
{% endhint %}

### Report types

Report types are defined in the `[report_definition_type]` column and can be:

#### Templates

This type of the report is self-contained and the final look will be exactly as in the template. When template is specified, the content of the `report_definition` field is passed into `sp_executesql` and passed into action for processing.

```sql
		if @definition_type = 'Template'
			begin
				insert into @template_build
				exec sp_executesql @report_definition

				select @html = [result] from @template_build
				set @html = '<html><head><style>' + @css + '</style><body><p>' + @report_description + '</p>' + @html + '<p>Email sent from SQLWATCH on host: ' + @@SERVERNAME +'
<a href="https://sqlwatch.io">https://sqlwatch.io</a></p></body></html>'
			end
```

This allows building completely custom reports

#### Queries

The Query type is a simpler version of the report. The `report_definition` must be a valid SQL Query which output will be converted to a html table and passed into action for processing.

```sql
		if @definition_type = 'Query'
			begin
				exec [dbo].[usp_sqlwatch_internal_query_to_html_table] @html = @html output, @query = @report_definition

				set @html = '<html><head><style>' + @css + '</style><body><p>' + @report_description + '</p>' + @html + '<p>Email sent from SQLWATCH on host: ' + @@SERVERNAME +'
<a href="https://sqlwatch.io">https://sqlwatch.io</a></p></body></html>'
			end
```

### Report Styling

Each report can have a custom `CSS` style. Styles are defined in table: `[dbo].[sqlwatch_config_report_style]`
