Please note, when installing SQLWATCH using dbatools, the deployment package will be downloaded to the PowerShell temporary directory. This will also include the Power BI template. If you are struggling to find it, you can grab a copy from GitHub: [https://github.com/marcingminski/sqlwatch/releases/latest](https://github.com/marcingminski/sqlwatch/releases/latest)
